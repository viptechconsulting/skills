# seo-sitemaps (M17)

Sitemaps are the discovery contract you hand the crawler — they should list exactly the canonical, indexable URLs and nothing else. Schema rules for related markup: `references/schema-tier1.md`.

## Inputs
Work from the PageSnapshot named in your dispatch envelope: read `parsed` from `<run_dir>/pages/<slug>.json` plus `<run_dir>/site/sitemaps.json` (+ `site/sitemap-urls.txt`), `<run_dir>/site/robots.json`, and `<run_dir>/crawl.json` for orphan reconciliation and per-URL status; Grep `pages/<slug>.html` for verbatim evidence. Deterministic findings already emitted by `audit.mjs` are listed in `<run_dir>/findings.deterministic.json` — do not re-emit those ids; add model-judged findings only. If invoked directly with a URL/path and no snapshot exists, first run `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/snapshot.mjs" <target> --out "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs"` and use the printed snapshot path.

## Audits
Working from the PageSnapshot (`parsed_rendered` when `render.used` is not `none`, else `parsed`) plus `site/sitemaps.json` and `site/robots.json`:
1. **Presence & validity**: locate XML sitemap(s) (`/sitemap.xml`, robots `Sitemap:` lines, sitemap index); parse as well-formed XML against the sitemaps.org schema.
2. **Size limits**: each sitemap `<=50,000` URLs and `<=50MB` uncompressed; if exceeded, expect a sitemap index splitting the set.
3. **Extensions**: where relevant, validate `image:`, `video:`, and `news:` namespace entries (correct namespace declared, required child elements present).
4. **lastmod accuracy**: `<lastmod>` is valid ISO 8601 and reflects real last-modified time — not a build-time stamp on every URL (which trains crawlers to ignore it).
5. **robots referencing**: at least one absolute `Sitemap:` line in `robots.txt`.
6. **Sitemap-to-canonical consistency**: no URL in the sitemap is `noindex`, redirected, 4xx/5xx, or non-canonical (self-referencing canonical only). Cross-check indexability with M-indexability.
7. **Orphan reconciliation**: diff sitemap URLs against the internal link graph — flag indexable pages absent from the sitemap and sitemap URLs unreachable by internal links.

## Fixes
- **AUTO**: generate or repair XML sitemap entries (correct `<loc>`, accurate `<lastmod>` from observed last-modified data, valid `image:`/`video:` extension children where media exists) and add an absolute `Sitemap:` line to `robots.txt`. These are additive/deterministic diffs for `fix`.
- **PROPOSED**: removing or splitting entries (e.g. dropping non-canonical/noindex URLs, sharding into a sitemap index) — drafted, accepted per-item.
- **ADVISORY**: changing site-wide lastmod strategy or canonical decisions — described, never written by the tool.
- **Never fabricate** lastmod times, media URLs, or canonical targets — pull from observed data, ask the user, or leave a clearly-marked `TODO` placeholder per the schema `fixable` contract.

## Verification
- From the run (no network): read `<run_dir>/site/sitemaps.json` and `<run_dir>/site/robots.json` — the crawl already walked the index, followed gzipped children and recorded the per-file errors.
- Re-fetch: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/parse-robots-sitemap.mjs" --url <final_url> [--max-sitemaps 50] [--max-urls 100000] [--no-well-known]` — method `xml_parse`: parses robots.txt + every declared and probed sitemap, checks well-formedness, size caps, namespace/extension validity, and the canonical/noindex consistency assertion. `--sitemap <sitemap url>` targets one file and `--file <robots.txt> [--path /x]` parses an offline robots file. This script has **no `--snapshot` mode**: sitemaps are site-level artifacts, not page snapshots.
- When the required data tier (live fetch of sitemap/robots, or the resolved link graph) is unavailable, status is `needs_api` — never a false `pass`.

## Findings
Emit findings per `schema/finding.schema.json`. Examples:
- `M17.sitemap.missing` — no XML sitemap found at `/sitemap.xml` or in robots.txt (status `fail`, severity 3, `fixable: auto`, axis `search`, confidence `established`).
- `M17.robots.no_sitemap_line` — sitemap exists but no `Sitemap:` line in robots.txt (status `warn`, severity 3, `fixable: auto`, axis `search`, confidence `established`).
- `M17.sitemap.noindex_url` — a `<loc>` in the sitemap points to a `noindex`/non-canonical URL (status `fail`, severity 3, `fixable: proposed`, axis `search`, confidence `established`).
- `M17.sitemap.error_url` — a `<loc>` the crawl fetched returned 4xx/5xx (status `fail`, severity 3, `fixable: proposed`, axis `search`, confidence `established`).
- `M17.sitemap.redirected_url` — a `<loc>` redirects instead of returning the final URL (status `warn`, severity 3, `fixable: proposed`, axis `search`, confidence `established`).
- `M17.sitemap.missing_indexable_url` — an indexable URL the crawl found is listed in no sitemap (status `warn`, severity 3, `fixable: proposed`, axis `search`, confidence `directional` — a well-linked page is discovered without a sitemap).
- `M17.sitemap.lastmod_identical` — every `<loc>` carries the same `<lastmod>`, so the file cannot distinguish a changed page from an unchanged one (status `warn`, severity 2, `fixable: advisory`, axis `search`, confidence `directional`).
Per-URL verdicts are only emitted for `<loc>` entries the crawl actually fetched; a URL that was never visited is left unreported rather than guessed. `M17.sitemap.missing` is also emitted as `needs_api` when sitemap discovery never ran in the run (`--artifacts none` / `--no-sitemaps`), which is a different fact from "no sitemap exists".
**Platform-conditional ids.** This module also emits 8 ids that fire only when `profile.json` names the platform (`shopify`, `wordpress`, `nextjs`, `nuxt`, `astro`, `gatsby`, `hugo`). They are indexed in `references/routing.md` § Platform-conditional finding ids and specified in `references/platforms/<id>.md` §10.

Each finding: `evidence.observed` quotes the page/sitemap verbatim; `verification.reproduce` is the runnable command above; `expected_impact` is banded + confidence-tagged (no naked %).

## Honesty
- A sitemap is a discovery aid, not a ranking signal or an indexing guarantee — Google treats `<lastmod>`, `<priority>`, and `<changefreq>` as hints, and `<priority>`/`<changefreq>` are largely ignored, so don't promise ranking lift from tuning them (label any such tactic low-magnitude/directional).
- Submitting a sitemap won't force indexing of low-quality or non-canonical pages; orphan and canonical hygiene matters more than sitemap size.

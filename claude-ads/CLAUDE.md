# Claude Ads: Free-first Paid Advertising Audit & Optimization Skill

## Project Overview

This repository contains **Claude Ads**, a Tier 4 Claude Code skill focused on the
3 base advertising platforms where 95% of ad spend lives: **Meta, Google, TikTok**.
It follows the Agent Skills open standard and the 3-layer architecture (directive,
orchestration, execution). After the v2.4.0 guided-onboarding refactor, the skill has
19 sub-skills, 7 agents (3 audit + 4 creative), 8 industry templates, ~158 weighted
audit checks + 3 cross-platform checks, **plus a guided first-run wizard (`/ads start`)
and a continuous coach (`/ads next`) backed by a persistent user profile + audit
history at `~/.claude-ads/`**.

## Removed in v2.3.0

The fork upstream covered 7 platforms; v2.3.0 refocuses on the 3 base. **Removed:**

- `ads-apple/` — no MCP exists for Apple Ads; partner-API setup high-friction.
- `ads-linkedin/` — LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform partner approval is a barrier; paid MCPs only.
- `ads-microsoft/` — lower advertiser usage; effort not justified.
- `ads-youtube/` — YouTube video campaigns live inside Google Ads; covered via `/ads google` and `audit-google` checks G-DG*, G-CTV*.

Also removed: cross-platform audit agents (`audit-creative`, `audit-tracking`, `audit-budget`, `audit-compliance`) — merged into `audit-tiktok.md`. Industry templates `saas`, `b2b-enterprise`, `info-products`, `mobile-app` deleted (depended on removed platforms).

## Development Rules

- Keep SKILL.md files under 500 lines / 5000 tokens
- Reference files should be focused and under 200 lines (enforced by `tests/test_references.py`)
- Scripts must have docstrings, CLI interface, and JSON output
- Follow kebab-case naming for all skill directories
- Agents invoked via Task tool with `context: fork`, never via Bash
- No hardcoded credentials; use MCP servers for external API access
- Every `audit-*` agent must emit **both** `<platform>-audit-results.md` (human-readable) and `<platform>-audit-results.json` (validates against `ads/references/audit-output-schema.json`). The orchestrator parses the JSON to aggregate scores; markdown is for human consumption only.
- Platform sub-skills (`ads-google`, `ads-meta`, `ads-tiktok`) declare only their platform-specific data-collection step, then delegate the 7-step audit process to `ads/references/audit-methodology.md`. Do not restate the generic process.
- Sub-skill frontmatter is canonically: `name` (matches directory), `description`, `user-invokable: false`. Skills with command arguments add `argument-hint`. Skills that need extra permissions add `allowed-tools`.
- New MCP integrations follow the **canonical pattern** documented in `ads/references/mcp-integration.md` and templated in `ads/references/mcp-meta-integration.md`: tools declared in the agent's `tools:` frontmatter, a `mcp-<platform>-integration.md` mapping checks↔tools, SKILL.md step 1 is MCP-first with manual fallback.
- Every platform audit must offer **three free-first data tiers** in this order:
  1. **Capa 1 — MCP** (server-based, recommended when one exists).
  2. **Capa 2 — Direct API** (script in `scripts/api/<platform>_fetch.py`, free, OAuth setup once).
  3. **Capa 3 — Manual exports** (always works, no setup).
  All adapters in `scripts/api/` are pure-stdlib (Python 3.10+, no external dependencies). See `scripts/api/README.md` for per-platform OAuth setup.
- Paid integrations (Adspirer for Meta MCP; Zernio for `/ads publish`) are documented as **optional Tier 3**. Never make a paid SaaS a required dependency.
- **Profile-first rule (NEW v2.4.0):** Any new user-facing command must check `~/.claude-ads/profile.json` for context before asking inline. Run `python3 scripts/profile.py get` first; on exit 2, surface a one-line tip to run `/ads start` but allow the user to proceed inline. Never store secrets (tokens, API keys) in the profile — only `*_present: true/false` flags. Use `scripts/profile.py set` to update fields so validation against `profile-schema.json` stays consistent.

## Quality Gates

Before merging a change that touches skills, agents, references, or scripts, run:

```bash
pytest tests/                                              # all must pass
find ads/references -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '$1 > 200'   # must be empty
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('ads/references/audit-output-schema.json'))"
bash -n install.sh && bash -n uninstall.sh
```

CI runs all of the above on every push and PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Releases

Cut releases via `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `gh release create vX.Y.Z`. Update `CHANGELOG.md` first. Bump version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff`, and the README version badges (both EN and ES). Install scripts compute the asset counts dynamically — no manual bump needed there.

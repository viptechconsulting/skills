# Ads: Free-first Paid Advertising Audit & Optimization

Focused ad account analysis on the 3 base platforms where most ad spend
lives: **Meta, Google, TikTok**. Orchestrates 19 specialized sub-skills and
7 agents (3 audit + 4 creative). First-run users should type **`/ads start`**
— a guided wizard that captures context, walks them through OAuth setup
step-by-step, and persists everything to `~/.claude-ads/profile.json` so no
future command ever re-asks.

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ads start` | **First-run wizard** — context capture, per-platform OAuth/MCP walkthroughs with live verification, optional Zernio + Meta Developers signup. Re-run as `/ads start edit/status/reset`. |
| `/ads next` | **Continuous coach** — reads recent audit JSON + history, ranks top 3 Quick Wins by impact × ease, optionally walks you through fixing #1. Detects regressions vs your last audit. |
| `/ads audit` | Full multi-platform audit with parallel subagent delegation (3 agents: Meta, Google, TikTok) |
| `/ads google` | Google Ads deep analysis (Search, PMax, includes YouTube video campaigns) |
| `/ads meta` | Meta Ads deep analysis (FB, IG, Advantage+) — MCP-wired to claude.ai Facebook |
| `/ads tiktok` | TikTok Ads deep analysis (Creative, Shop, Smart+, Symphony, GMV Max) |
| `/ads creative` | Cross-platform creative quality audit |
| `/ads landing` | Landing page quality assessment for ad campaigns |
| `/ads budget` | Budget allocation and bidding strategy review |
| `/ads plan <business-type>` | Strategic ad plan with industry templates |
| `/ads competitor` | Competitor ad intelligence analysis |
| `/ads math` | PPC financial calculator (CPA, ROAS, break-even, budget forecasting) |
| `/ads test` | A/B test design (hypothesis, significance, duration, sample size) |
| `/ads report` | PDF audit report generation for client deliverables |
| `/ads dna <url>` | Extract brand DNA from website, outputs `brand-profile.json` |
| `/ads create` | Generate campaign concepts + copy briefs, outputs `campaign-brief.md` |
| `/ads generate` | Generate AI ad images from brief, outputs to `ad-assets/` |
| `/ads photoshoot` | Product photography in 5 styles (Studio, Floating, Ingredient, In Use, Lifestyle) |
| `/ads update <platform\|all>` | Refresh per-platform references with last 30 days of changes (COSTLY: ~50–150k tokens/platform; gates on confirmation) |
| `/ads publish` | Publish generated creatives to 14+ social networks via Zernio (first 2 accounts free; see `skills/ads-publish/SKILL.md`) |

## First-run behavior

When the user invokes any `/ads` command **other than** `/ads start`,
`/ads math`, or `/ads test`, FIRST run:

```bash
python3 scripts/profile.py get
```

- Exit code `2` (profile missing) → gently surface a one-line tip:
  > *Tip: run `/ads start` first — it saves ~30 sec per future command. Proceed inline instead? (Y/N)*
  Honor `N` (proceed) by falling back to the inline Context Intake below.
- Exit code `0` (profile present) → parse the JSON and use the saved
  `context.industry`, `context.monthly_spend_usd`, `context.primary_goal`,
  `context.active_platforms` directly. Do NOT re-ask. Only re-ask if a field
  is `null`/empty.

## Context Intake (fallback — only when profile is missing AND user declined `/ads start`)

Without context, benchmarks will be generic and recommendations may be wrong
for the user's situation.

Ask these questions upfront (combine into one message):

1. **Industry / Business type**: Which best describes you?
   E-commerce · Local Service · Real Estate · Healthcare · Finance · Agency · Other
   (Note: B2B-enterprise, SaaS, mobile-app, and info-products templates were removed in v2.3.0 since they depended on LinkedIn/Apple/YouTube which are no longer audited; use the `generic` template plus the platform-specific skills below.)
2. **Monthly ad spend**: Total budget and per-platform breakdown (approximate is fine)
3. **Primary goal**: Sales / Revenue · Leads / Demos · App Installs · Calls · Brand
4. **Active platforms**: Of the 3 supported (Meta, Google, TikTok), which are you advertising on?

If the user provides data upfront (e.g. "audit my Google Ads, I spend $5k/mo on ecommerce"),
extract context from that and proceed without re-asking.

After the inline intake, offer: *"Want me to save this to your profile so I
never re-ask? (runs `/ads start` quickly with your answers prefilled)."*

Use the provided context to:
- Select the correct industry benchmarks from `references/benchmarks.md`
- Apply budget-appropriate recommendations (e.g. Smart Bidding requires 15+ conv/month)
- Calibrate severity scoring (a $500/mo account has different priorities than $50k/mo)

## Orchestration Logic

When the user invokes `/ads audit`, delegate to subagents in parallel:
1. **Load context** — run `python3 scripts/profile.py get`. If profile exists, use it. If exit 2, fall back to inline Context Intake (and offer to save via `/ads start` at the end).
2. Collect account data (exports, screenshots, or pasted metrics — for connected platforms use the saved tier in `connections.<p>.tier`)
3. Detect business type and identify active platforms (from `context.active_platforms` if available)
4. Spawn subagents via Task tool with `context: fork` — only for `context.active_platforms` (or those with `connections.<p>.tier != "skipped"`): `audit-google`, `audit-meta`, `audit-tiktok`
5. **Validate**: each subagent writes both `<platform>-audit-results.json` and `<platform>-audit-results.md`. Parse the JSON and validate against `references/audit-output-schema.json` before aggregating. If any subagent's JSON is missing or invalid, surface the error and stop — do not silently aggregate partial results.
6. Aggregate scores using the platform-budget-share formula in `references/scoring-system.md` and generate the unified Ads Health Score (0-100)
7. Create prioritized action plan from the `quick_wins` and `critical_issues` arrays of each JSON
8. **Persist to history** — for each new audit JSON: `python3 scripts/profile.py save-audit <platform>-audit-results.json`. This feeds `/ads next` regression detection.
9. **Suggest the next step** — point the user at `/ads next` for ranked Quick Wins.

For individual commands (`/ads google`, `/ads meta`, etc.), load the relevant
sub-skill directly. Still load profile / collect context first if not already
provided.

For `/ads update <platform|all>`, route to `skills/ads-update/SKILL.md`. The update
skill enforces a mandatory cost-confirmation gate before fetching — do NOT bypass
it. See `references/update-cost-warning.md` for the rationale.

## Creative Workflow

Sequential pipeline (each step is independently runnable):
1. `/ads dna <url>` → `brand-profile.json` in current directory
2. `/ads create` → reads profile + optional audit results → `campaign-brief.md`
3. `/ads generate` → reads brief + profile → `ad-assets/` directory
4. `/ads photoshoot` → standalone or reads profile for style injection

Requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini default) or `ADS_IMAGE_PROVIDER` + matching key.
If API key is missing, `/ads generate` and `/ads photoshoot` display setup
instructions and exit; they never fail silently.

## Industry Detection

Detect business type from ad account signals:
- **SaaS**: trial_start/demo_request events, pricing page targeting, long attribution windows
- **E-commerce**: purchase events, product catalog/feed, Shopping/PMax campaigns
- **Local Service**: call extensions, location targeting, store visits, directions events
- **B2B Enterprise**: LinkedIn Ads active, ABM lists, high CPA tolerance ($50+), long sales cycle
- **Info Products**: webinar/course funnels, lead gen forms, low-ticket offers
- **Mobile App**: app install campaigns, in-app events, deep linking
- **Real Estate**: listing feeds, property-specific landing pages, geo-heavy targeting
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance flags, healthcare-specific ad policies
- **Finance**: Special Ad Categories declared, financial products compliance
- **Agency**: multiple client accounts, white-label reporting needs

## Quality Gates

Hard rules (never violate these):
- Never recommend Broad Match without Smart Bidding (Google)
- 3x Kill Rule: flag any ad group/campaign with CPA >3x target for pause
- Budget sufficiency: Meta ≥5x CPA per ad set, TikTok ≥50x CPA per ad group
- Learning phase: never recommend edits during active learning phase
- Compliance: always check Special Ad Categories for housing/employment/credit/finance
- Creative: never run silent video ads on TikTok (sound-on platform)
- Attribution: default to 7-day click / 1-day view (Meta), data-driven (Google)
- Andromeda creative diversity: Flag Meta accounts with <10 genuinely distinct creatives
- Privacy infrastructure gate: Always verify tracking stack (Consent Mode V2, CAPI, Events API, AdAttributionKit) before making optimization recommendations
- PDF report quality gate: When generating reports via `/ads report`, always use `scripts/generate_report.py` with `--check` first. Reports must have: clean layout with no overlapping elements, proper margins (0.75in), word-wrapped table cells (no clipping), all charts/images sized within page boundaries, page numbers and section dividers, captions on every visual, and zero empty sections. Run `--check` before `--output` and fix any warnings before delivering the PDF

## Reference Files

Load these on-demand as needed; do NOT load all at startup.

**Path resolution:** All references are installed at `~/.claude/skills/ads/references/`.
When sub-skills or agents reference `ads/references/*.md`, resolve to
`~/.claude/skills/ads/references/*.md`.

- `references/audit-methodology.md`: **Shared 7-step audit process** all platform skills delegate to. Single source of truth for the audit skeleton, check ID convention, MCP-first rule, and output contract reference.
- `references/audit-output-schema.json`: **Canonical JSON schema** every audit-* agent must emit. The orchestrator validates against this before aggregating cross-platform scores. New integrations conform to this contract.
- `references/profile-schema.json`: Schema for `~/.claude-ads/profile.json` — the persistent user context written by `/ads start` and read by every command.
- `references/audit-history-schema.json`: Schema for `~/.claude-ads/history/index.json` — the audit log `/ads next` reads for regression detection.
- `references/setup-meta.md` / `setup-google.md` / `setup-tiktok.md`: Step-by-step OAuth + MCP + manual connection walkthroughs loaded by `/ads start` Phase C.
- `references/setup-zernio.md` / `setup-meta-developers.md`: Account-creation walkthroughs for optional integrations.
- `references/scoring-system.md`: Weighted scoring algorithm and grading thresholds
- `references/benchmarks.md`: Industry benchmarks by platform (CPC, CTR, CVR, ROAS)
- `references/bidding-strategies.md`: Bidding decision trees per platform
- `references/budget-allocation.md`: Platform selection matrix, scaling rules, MER
- `references/platform-specs.md`: Creative specifications across all platforms
- `references/conversion-tracking.md`: Pixel, CAPI, EMQ, ttclid implementation
- `references/compliance.md`: Regulatory requirements, ad policies, privacy
- `references/google-audit.md`: 80-check Google Ads audit checklist (includes YouTube video campaigns)
- `references/meta-audit.md`: 50-check Meta Ads audit checklist
- `references/tiktok-audit.md`: 28-check TikTok Ads audit checklist
- `references/brand-dna-template.md`: Brand DNA schema and extraction guide
- `references/image-providers.md`: Provider config (Gemini/OpenAI/Stability/Replicate)
- `references/google-creative-specs.md`: PMax/RSA/YouTube generation-ready specs
- `references/meta-creative-specs.md`: Feed/Reels/Stories specs + safe zones
- `references/tiktok-creative-specs.md`: 9:16 only + safe zone overlay
- `references/gaql-notes.md`: GAQL field compatibility, deduplication patterns, filter scope best practices
- `references/voice-to-style.md`: Brand voice axis to visual attribute mapping for image generation
- `references/copy-frameworks.md`: 6 ad copy frameworks (AIDA, PAS, BAB, 4P, FAB, Star-Story-Solution)
- `references/mcp-integration.md`: Canonical MCP integration pattern + per-platform MCP server catalog
- `references/mcp-meta-integration.md`: Meta MCP check↔tool mapping (template for new MCP integrations)

For platforms where MCP is not the preferred path, the audit agent reads
`<platform>-data.json` produced by `scripts/api/<platform>_fetch.py`.
These are pure-stdlib API adapters covering Meta, Google, and TikTok.
See `scripts/api/README.md` for the per-platform OAuth setup walkthrough.

## Scoring Methodology

### Ads Health Score (0-100)

Per-platform score using weighted algorithm from `references/scoring-system.md`.
Cross-platform aggregate weighted by budget share:

```
Aggregate = Sum(Platform_Score x Platform_Budget_Share)
```

### Grading

| Grade | Score | Action Required |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| A | 90-100 | Minor optimizations only |
| B | 75-89 | Some improvement opportunities |
| C | 60-74 | Notable issues need attention |
| D | 40-59 | Significant problems present |
| F | <40 | Urgent intervention required |

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Revenue/data loss risk (fix immediately)
- **High**: Significant performance drag (fix within 7 days)
- **Medium**: Optimization opportunity (fix within 30 days)
- **Low**: Best practice, minor impact (backlog)

## Subagents

For parallel analysis during full audits — one deep specialist per platform:
- `audit-google`: Google Ads 80-check audit (G01-G74, G-PM*, G-AI*, G-DG*, G-CTV*, G-WS*, G-KW*, G-CT*, G-AD*)
- `audit-meta`: Meta Ads 50-check audit (M01-M40, M-AN*, M-AT*, M-CR*, M-ST*, M-IA*, M-TH*) — MCP-wired
- `audit-tiktok`: TikTok Ads 28-check audit (T01-T25, T-SR*) — consolidates the former audit-creative/tracking/budget/compliance for TikTok into one deep-specialist agent

Creative pipeline agents (unchanged):
- `creative-strategist`: Campaign concepts from brand profile + audit results (Opus, maxTurns: 25)
- `visual-designer`: Image generation with brand injection via generate_image.py (Sonnet, maxTurns: 30)
- `copy-writer`: Headlines, CTAs, primary text within platform limits (Sonnet, maxTurns: 20)
- `format-adapter`: Asset dimension validation and spec compliance reporting (Haiku, maxTurns: 15)
